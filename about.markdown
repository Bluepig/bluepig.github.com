# About

I work as a software engineer at [Getty Images](http://gettyimages.com/). I also run my own freelance web development company [Source Blueprints](http://sourceblueprints.com/) where I do Rails and iPhone projects.

I studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington. While at UW, I did two internships with [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) on the Mac Excel team. After graduation, I worked for Microsoft from 1995 to 2005 in SQL Server, bCentral, and Xbox Live. After Microsoft, I worked at several startups including Source Labs, Pure Networks, and Jobster.

I've always been an [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) fan. My first computer was an Apple IIc. Around 1998, I started to use Linux. I got into [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) while at Jobster and now am primarily a web services developer using Rails, Mac OS X, and Linux.

Outside work, I'm an avid cyclist, play electric guitar badly, and enjoy soccer especially the English Premier League.
