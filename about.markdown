# About

My name is Andrew Carter. I live near Seattle, WA in the United States. I am a Principal Software Developer for [Hulu] in Seattle. I work on device development, and backend services.

I studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington. While at UW, I did two internships with Microsoft on the Mac Excel team. After graduation, I worked for Microsoft from 1995 to 2005 in SQL Server, bCentral, and Xbox Live. After Microsoft, I worked at several startups including Source Labs, Pure Networks, and Jobster. I worked for three years as a senior software engineer at Getty Images. After Getty, I spent about 6 months working as a freelance mobile and Ruby on Rails developer.

I've always been an Apple user. My first computer was an Apple IIc. Around 1998, I started to use Linux. I began developing with Ruby on Rails while at Jobster. Currently, I program with Ruby on Rails, Python, Objective-C, and Java. I use iOS, Android, Mac OS X, and Ubuntu Linux. I have a strong interested in high level languages so I'm always trying out the latest (next up - Clojure).

Outside of work, I'm an avid cyclist and skier. I also enjoy football especially the Seattle Sounders and English Premier League.
