My name is Andrew Carter. I live near Seattle, WA. I am a Principal Software Developer for [Hulu] in Seattle. I work on device development, backend services, and system automation.

I studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington. I did two internships with Microsoft on the Mac Excel team. After graduation, I worked for Microsoft from 1995 to 2005 in SQL Server, bCentral, and Xbox Live. After Microsoft, I worked at several startups including Source Labs, Pure Networks, and Jobster. I also worked at Getty Images for three years as a Senior Software Engineer.

I currently program in Ruby, Python, Objective-C, C, and Java on Mac OS X and Linux.

Outside of work, I'm an avid cyclist and skier. I also enjoy football especially the Seattle Sounders.
