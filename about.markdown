# About

I own a web development firm [Source Blueprints, LLC][sourceblueprints]  where I specialize in Ruby on Rails and mobile projects on the iOS and Android platforms.

I studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington. While at UW, I did two internships with Microsoft on the Mac Excel team. After graduation, I worked for Microsoft from 1995 to 2005 in SQL Server, bCentral, and Xbox Live. After Microsoft, I worked at several startups including Source Labs, Pure Networks, and Jobster. Most recently, I worked for three years as a senior software engineer at Getty Images.

I've always been an Apple user. My first computer was an Apple IIc. Around 1998, I started to use Linux. I got into Ruby on Rails while at Jobster. Currently, I do development using Ruby on Rails, iOS, and Android on Mac OS X and Ubuntu Linux.

Outside work, I'm an avid cyclist, play electric guitar badly, and enjoy soccer especially the English Premier League.
