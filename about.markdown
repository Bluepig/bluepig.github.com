# About

My name is Andrew Carter. I live near Seattle, WA in the United States.

I own a web development firm [Sparse Labs, LLC][sparse]. I specialize in Ruby on Rails and mobile projects on iOS and Android platforms.

I studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington. While at UW, I did two internships with Microsoft on the Mac Excel team. After graduation, I worked for Microsoft from 1995 to 2005 in SQL Server, bCentral, and Xbox Live. After Microsoft, I worked at several startups including Source Labs, Pure Networks, and Jobster. Most recently, I worked for three years as a senior software engineer at Getty Images.

I've always been an Apple user. My first computer was an Apple IIc. Around 1998, I started to use Linux. I got into Ruby on Rails while at Jobster. Currently, I develop using Ruby on Rails, iOS, Android and use Mac OS X and Ubuntu Linux.

Outside work, I'm an avid cyclist and enjoy football especially the English Premier League.
